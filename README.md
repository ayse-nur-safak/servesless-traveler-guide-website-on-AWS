# Website Design on AWS  
## Project Proposal
**<div>Project Topic: Serverless Website Design on AWS</div>**
**<div>Project Name: Traveler Guide Website for Turkey</div>**
#### 1. Introduction
Tourists want to travel in Turkey, but they do not know about where to visit. The project is about creating a website for solving this problem. This website helps people to understand more easily and make the way smoother about travelling. The site will guide the tourist by giving some introductions and advices. It will include many of the most touristic cities in Turkey. In this way, tourists who want to travel to these cities in Turkey will choose the places they should visit in the cities or the cities they will go to according to the type of holiday they want to do.
#### 2. Project Description
###### I. Overview
It is a website that gives advice on the most popular and must-see places in the cities that tourists will visit, in Turkey. After selecting one of the 7 regions of Turkey, the provinces attached to the guide will be shown. After that, by clicking on the city that tourists want to visit, they will get recommendations on places to visit in that city.
###### II. Objectives
The main objective is guiding the cities to the tourists. Therefore, they will be feeling confident about travelling. They will be directed and get some important advice before going.
The website is going to be useful and understandable. Customers from all ages can understand the website. Not only writings, but there will also be visual effects for making website more fun and eye catching.
We will put every city in different box, so the user can find the city easily. Also, we are thinking about putting search box for making website clearer and easier to use. 
Also, the website will be responsive. Therefore, website is also usable for mobile phones.
<div>There are 8 functional requirments. Firstly, the website should meet visitors with an attractive visual as a main page. Secondly, tourists should choose one of the 7 regions of Turkey they want to go visit by clicking on the page showing the regions.</div>
<div>Non-functional</div>

###### III.	Target Customers

Target customers are the tourists that mostly come from abroad. On the other hand, local people need help about where and how to travel.
We aim to not only travelers will use this website, but also couriers (people who guides tourists) will use the website. They can gain their knowledge. 
 
###### IV.	Value Proposition

Tourists want to travel in Turkey, but they do not know about how to travel or where to go. Couriers are expensive and they are not for deciding the travelling place. When we look at the other travelling websites, we realize that they are complicated and very long. We are going to keep the website simple as possible as we can. We will show specific areas to travel and do a point shoot for helping in a simple way. 

After this project tourists recognize that travelling Turkey is not hard as they think.
Because of this website, they can travel and enjoy the city in a right way and collect good memories. Therefore, more tourists will travel and visit. This will improve the tourism.
