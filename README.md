# Website Design on AWS  
## Project Proposal
**<div>Project Topic: Serverless Website Design on AWS</div>**
**<div>Project Name: Traveler Guide Website for Turkey</div>**
#### 1. Introduction
Tourists want to travel in Turkey, but they do not know about where to visit. The project is about creating a website for solving this problem. This website helps people to understand more easily and make the way smoother about travelling. The site will guide the tourist by giving some introductions and advices. It will include many of the most touristic cities in Turkey. In this way, tourists who want to travel to these cities in Turkey will choose the places they should visit in the cities or the cities they will go to according to the type of holiday they want to do.
#### 2. Project Description
###### I. Overview
It is a website that gives advice on the most popular and must-see places in the cities that tourists will visit, in Turkey. After selecting one of the 7 regions of Turkey, the provinces attached to the guide will be shown. After that, by clicking on the city that tourists want to visit, they will get recommendations on places to visit in that city.
###### II. Objectives
The main objective is guiding the cities to the tourists. Therefore, they will be feeling confident about travelling. They will be directed and get some important advice before going.
The website is going to be useful and understandable. Customers from all ages can understand the website. Not only writings, but there will also be visual effects for making website more fun and eye catching.
We will put every city in different box, so the user can find the city easily. Also, we are thinking about putting search box for making website clearer and easier to use. 
Also, the website will be responsive. Therefore, website is also usable for mobile phones.
<p>There are six functional requirments. Firstly, the website shall meet visitors with an attractive visual as a main page. Secondly, tourists shall choose one of the 7 regions of Turkey they want to go visit by clicking on the page showing the regions. Thirdly, they shall choose one of the cities belonging to their chosen region by clicking on the page showing the cities. Fourtly, the website shall show recommendations for the city of their city choice. Fifthly, from the search bar on the homepage and on each page shown, users shall be able to search for a city name or recommended places directly over the search bar. Lastly, there will be an admin panel. Through this admin panel, website administrators or editors will be able to easily edit site content.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there shall be three non-functional requirments. Firstly, necessary security measures shall be taken to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to the admin panel. Secondly, users should not be able to run scripts on the search button on the website in order to security reasons. Thirdly, the response time of the website shall be under 0.5 seconds.</p>

###### III.	Target Customers
- Tourists which will come from abroad.
- Locals 
- People who guides tourists 
###### IV.	Value Proposition

Tourists want to travel in Turkey, but they do not know about how to travel or where to go. Couriers are expensive and they are not for deciding the travelling place. When we look at the other travelling websites, we realize that they are complicated and very long. We are going to keep the website simple as possible as we can. We will show specific areas to travel and do a point shoot for helping in a simple way. 

After this project tourists recognize that travelling Turkey is not hard as they think.
Because of this website, they can travel and enjoy the city in a right way and collect good memories. Therefore, more tourists will travel and visit. This will improve the tourism.
